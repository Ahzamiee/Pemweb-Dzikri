            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Born in Jakarta March 17, 2006, I was the first of three children called Dzikri</p>
            <p>As a first child, I was an example to my siblings and carried with me the high hopes of both parents of being shocked and successful in the future, having graduated from junior high and high school boarding schools, with the religious support I had on my way to becoming a technologist.</p>         
            <p>This interest grew over the years in which I was interested in learning more about the proposed programming and design world such as canva or figma where my creativity was developed and tested.</p>
            <p>Beyond that I also have hobbies like playing badminton, reading books and watching movies so that my life doesn't get boring.</p>
